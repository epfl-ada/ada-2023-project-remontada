text: Cerveza pale lager gabonesa. MÃ¡s floja que la Regab.Aroma escaso, apariencia pÃ¡lida, muy poco cuerpo y poco regusto en el paladar.Si algÃºn dÃ­a fuera a GabÃ³n pedirÃ­a una mÃ¡s para volver a probarla y el resto del tiempo pedirÃ­a la Regab sin duda, que tampoco es que sea nada del otro mundo, pero es superior a Ã©sta.

Ejemplo: Cruzcampo.He probado lagers mucho peores que Ã©sta, siendo de un paÃ­s como GabÃ³n al que no se le presupone demasiada tradiciÃ³n cervecera.Aroma escaso, apariencia similar a la de todas las lager. Poco cuerpo y un sabor agradable al paladar pero sin mucho mÃ¡s.Cerveza que ronda el 4,5 - 5 sobre 10.

Grassy dry with a very curious metallic edge in the finish (qualitatively different than the metallic bitterness Iâve had in American lagers).  Something in the flavor reminded me of a chili.  Not good at all.  Thanks to John W. for bringing back a large bottle from his travels in Africa.

Initially little in way of cardamom but a spicy tingle creeps in at end but only because Iâm searching for it. A little too cold really, becomes dusty, sweeter, thinner as it warms.

Fruity and sweet with a well balanced bitterness. Well crafted. Medium body. Quite refreshing and a nice pale ale, actually I thinks itâs one of the best English Pale Ales I have tasted. A nice surprise!

text: On gravity at the Belfast Beer Festival, 2013.Fairly light oxblood with no head. Bits of chocolate, roast and black grape on the nose. Grape soda, a spec of chocolate, some prune, coffee hard candy, and a bit of spice. Spiced apple tart finish and dry linger. Thin, clean, slight.No real complexity, too thin, no roast and far too sweet. A stretch to call it a mild, as the catalog said. Not worth the 4.4%; disappointing for a local.
